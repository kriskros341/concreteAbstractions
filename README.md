# concreteAbstractions
My progress through Concrete Abstractions. Link in README
Done in python instead of scheme, because I'm not a masochist.
By describing a function Recursive/Iterative I focus on the process, rather than describing function. (I realized there is a difference between a function and a process half way through the book, so there are quite a lot recursive functions that do iterative tasks described as iterative.) Since Scheme doesn't have a for/while loops, I try to avoid them.

The book is available for free on author's website
